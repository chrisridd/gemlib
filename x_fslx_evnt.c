 *  @param fsd Descriptor that was passed at a successful
 *         opening of a file selector 
 *         window.
 *  @param events EVENT structure as for wdlg_evnt and
 *		   fnts_evnt. The events are serviced by
 *		   the dialog if they are intended for the
 *		   associated window.
 *  @param path Pointer to the selected path if the 
 *		   dialog was quit successfully, i.e. by a
 *		   click on the OK button or by double-
 *		   clicking on a file.
 *  @param fname Pointer to the selected filename if the 
 *		   dialog was quit successfully, i.e. by a
 *		   click on the OK button or by double-
 *		   clicking on a file.
 *  @param button  \n
 *             [option CHECK_NULLPTR] button may be NULL
 *  @param nfiles  \n
 *             [option CHECK_NULLPTR] nfiles may be NULL
 *  @param sort_mode  \n
 *             [option CHECK_NULLPTR] sort_mode may be NULL
 *  @param pattern  \n
 *             [option CHECK_NULLPTR] pattern may be NULL
 *  @param global_aes global AES array
 *
 *  @return Is 0 if the dialog is to be quit, else 1
 *
 *  @since mt_appl_getinfo(7) give informations on mt_fslx_xx() functions availability
 *
 *  Events, i.e. mouse clicks, messages and keypresses are passed on to the 
 *  file selector window and serviced by it if appropriate. When an event 
 *  has been serviced then the corresponding bit in the EVENT structure will 
 *  be cleared.
